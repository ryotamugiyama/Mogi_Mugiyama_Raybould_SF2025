Replication codes for the paper: Mogi, Ryohei, Ryota Mugiyama, and Alyce Raybould. 2025. “Exposure to Non-partnership and Fertility Desires among Childless Population in Japan.” *Social Forces.* Advance Access. https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf123

The way to replicate the code
1. Download the "replication_SF" folder and put it to your local folder (hereafter refered to as "project" folder).
2. Create "results" and "data" folder for your "project" folder.
3. Put JLPS 2007-2023 data to your "data" folder.
4. Set your "project" folder as working directory in your Stata.
5. Run the "_master.do"
6. If you would like to make Figure 1, 2, A1, and Table A2, you need to use R.
